	Joe Abi Nassif:
		I read from different papers about position-based dynamics in general (main loop, idea of constraints, etc) and cloths in particular (mesh representation, constraints, etc). I also experimented with mesh creation in Unity3D using vertices and indices and read about the half-edge data structure which helps describe and iterate over meshes.
