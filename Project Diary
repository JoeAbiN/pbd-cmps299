	Joe Abi Nassif:
		I read from different papers about position-based dynamics in general (main loop, idea of constraints, etc) and cloths in particular (mesh representation, constraints, etc). I also experimented with mesh creation in Unity3D using vertices and indices and read about the half-edge data structure which helps describe and iterate over meshes.
  Mohammed Al Makdah:
    I read the parts of the research paper that explain Position Based Dynamics and understood the concept of it and the algorithm behind it, I also watched videos that explain the idea more, I looked at sample codes in unity C# that implement this idea and algorithm and got a general idea on how the code and the organization of it should look. I also learned how to create meshes in unity using triangles.
