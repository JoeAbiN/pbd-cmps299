### Joe Abi Nassif: 
I read from different papers about position-based dynamics in general (main loop, idea of constraints, etc) and cloths in particular (mesh representation, constraints, etc). I also experimented with mesh creation in Unity3D using vertices and indices and read about the half-edge data structure which helps describe and iterate over meshes. 

### Mohammed Al Makdah: 
I read the parts of the research paper that explain Position Based Dynamics and understood the concept of it and the algorithm behind it, I also watched videos that explain the idea more, I looked at sample codes in unity C# that implement this idea and algorithm and got a general idea on how the code and the organization of it should look. I also learned how to create meshes in unity using triangles. 

### Hassan Faour: 
I worked with OpenMesh binaries and built an example from openmesh's tutorials. I also read the different papers, found in the below links. Working with Openmesh was challenging, I am still tinkering with the packages. I found I have alot of difficulty with the physics base of the papers, and more studies need to be done. I also created a trianble mesh on Unity following a tutorial on youtube.

### Joe Abi Nassif:
I familiarized myself with an implementation of the Vertex, Triangle, Edge, HalfEdge, and Plane classes in Unity and created a manifold mesh of triangles using the Vertex and Triangle classes. I also studied a way to get a list of half-edges from a given list of triangles, which could be useful for iterating over a mesh and accessing various data such as edges, vertices and faces.
